= HTML Example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to PDF through the docbook AsciiDoctor
plugin and then the jdocbook gradle plugin.

Some notes:

* I found little canonical information. There is a lot of trial-and-error here.
* The jdocbook plugin requires stylesheets. They were taken from 
  https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/docbook-reference-plugin[the spring "docbook-reference-plugin"].
* The stylesheet requires java-libraries. The two that were needed to build this documentation were
  (xslthl and saxon) were taken from https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/docbook-reference-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML5 by invoking the 'asciidoctor' goal:

 $ ./gradlew buildDocs

Open the file _build/asciidoc/html/example-manual.html_  in your browser to see the generated HTML file.
